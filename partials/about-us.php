                <p>
                    JGB! Neat Design is currently a one-man-show online technology company owned and operated by Jean GÃ©rard Bousiquot, a Web & Mobile Developer from Delmas, Haiti.

                <p>
                    Bousiquot has been developing for the web and mobile platforms for a couple of years now. He uses awesome technologies to build awesome web & mobile applications for his clients, ranging from individuals to small businesses in the area. A fanatic of new technologies, he tries his best not to fall to the trap of spending too much time learning a new tool or framework that might be useless for his personal or clients' projects. He also runs a <a href="<?= get_permalink(get_option('page_for_posts' )); ?>">blog</a> on new technologies, libraries, frameworks and other tools he uses on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When he's not behind a computer screen you can find him surfing the internet from his phone or playing video games or something like that. Yeah but not especially in that order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also loves to read books and articles, but mainly techninal ones; speaks and writes in 4 languages: Creole, French, English and Spanish (actually that one, he uses it rarely.)
